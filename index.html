          <p>
            This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating
            the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to
            prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to
            show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise
            static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is
            possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods,
            and logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you
            are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you
            add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring
            your code. If it takes you 3 hours to figure out the logic, it
            should likely take you another 3 hours determining that you wrote
            the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will
            feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your
            final submission.

          <h2>What You Will Build</h2>
          <p>
            You will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we
            don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or
            an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the
            content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the
            navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation
            is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will
            experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed
            should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user
            clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the
            appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.
          </p>
          <p>
            This may not sound like a lot, but there are a fair amount of moving
            pieces that rely on each other to work. You’ll need to plan out the
            logic of what you are trying to accomplish before you begin
            developing. If you find this process to be quick, there’s a list of
            additional functionality that you can add that all strive to improve
            the users’ experience.

            The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine
            your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside
            from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you’ll
            discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

            The following are just some of the questions that you’ll experience
            along the way:
            <li>What’s the ideal workflow?</li>
            <li>How many files do I need?</li>
            <li>Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?</li>
            <li>How many JavaScript functions do I need?</li>
            <li>Should my function be this many lines of code?</li>
            <li>Is readability or performance more important?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There’s no single correct answer to each question. While building
            this project, working with peers, and getting feedback from the
            project reviewer -- you will naturally develop your own answers to
            these questions!

            For this project, you will be writing most of your code in
            <strong>js/app.js</strong>. Note that it's very important that you
            <em>plan your project</em>
            before you start writing any code! Break your project down into
            small pieces of work and strategize your approach to each one. With
            these bite-sized amounts, it'll be easier to debug and fix any
            issues that appear.
